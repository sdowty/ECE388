# ECE388

This BOM outines the materials needed to make a voltmeter. 
The resistors and capacitors are needed to createthe attenuators that will be used for the input to the ADC pins. 
The Adafruit OLED is the display that will be used to show the voltage value.
The design also needs the AVR-ISP which is 6 pins that will connect to the Atmega328PB for programming.
The micro-usb will be used to power the system with 5 Volts.
